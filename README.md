## An experimental keyboard to improve speed and accuracy on mobile devices

### Advantages:

- fast once learned
- more accurate: having less(6) tap areas greatly reduces the rate of misstyping on handheld devices
- when used on pre-printed paper, it can overcome illegible handwriting

#### Disadvantages:

- slower while still learning
- adoption & acceptance

_This concept is similar to Braille, but without diagonal patterns. Thus this new implementation is optimized for hand gestures on touch devices._
